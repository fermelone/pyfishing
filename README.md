 An Albion Online Autom... helper

Just open `pyfishing.py` and give it a read, it's all commented and well explained.

Based on this original post: https://habr.com/ru/post/459110/  
But added comments, config options, and improved a few things here and there.

Also added `cannytester.py` for you to test what's the best config for your canny edge detection, based on this article [here](https://simplycodebased.org/opencv-jetpack/build-a-canny-edge-detector-slider-for-opencv/)

Happy fishing!
